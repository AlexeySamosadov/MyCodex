# Warp/OB1 Functional Parity Roadmap for Codex

## 0. Vision and Success Metrics
- **Goal:** Deliver a Codex experience that matches or exceeds Warp and OB1 across terminal UX, agentic assistance, collaboration, and long-lived context retention while remaining GPT-first.
- **Guiding principles:**
  - Preserve Codex strengths (agent tooling, MCP integration, scriptable CLI) while layering premium terminal UX.
  - Ensure every feature remains usable in air-gapped/sandboxed environments when possible, with graceful degradation otherwise.
  - Establish measurable outcomes (latency, command success rate, reasoning quality, retention length) and track them continuously.

## 1. Discovery & Gap Analysis (Weeks 1–3)
- **Catalogue features** of Warp and OB1: command palette, block-based output, real-time suggestions, notebooks, collaboration, AI command search, workflows, templates, cloud sync, etc.
- **Map to Codex:** document which capabilities already exist (MCP tools, exec mode, session history) and identify gaps.
- **User research:** interview current Codex users and Warp/OB1 power-users to validate priorities.
- **Deliverables:** feature matrix, prioritized backlog, definition of MVP parity scope.

## 2. Architecture Foundations (Weeks 2–6)
- **Terminal engine:** decide whether to extend existing TUI (ratatui) or embed GPU-accelerated renderer; draft RFC covering block rendering, diffing, panes, scrollback, and emoji/ligature support.
- **Service topology:** document how Codex CLI, daemon, and cloud services communicate; design API surfaces for AI suggestions, memory, and collaboration.
- **Extensibility:** formalize plugin/tooling API (building on MCP) for third-party integrations and workflows.
- **Deliverables:** architecture RFCs, milestone plan, engineering resourcing estimates. See `warp-ob1-architecture-foundations.md` for detailed execution guidance.

## 3. Long-Context & Memory Strategy (Weeks 3–8)
- **Session memory hierarchy:**
  - Short-term: conversational buffer with summarization every N turns.
  - Mid-term: vector store (local first, optional cloud sync) for embeddings of commands, files, and decisions.
  - Long-term: project-level knowledge base curated by a "Project Manager" agent.
- **Persistence model:** design schemas for project timelines, decision logs, risks, TODOs; ensure encryption at rest + RBAC.
- **Context rejuvenation:** implement retrieval pipelines (RAG) that automatically rehydrate agent prompts with relevant memory slices.
- **Evaluation:** create benchmarks measuring retained facts after 1K/5K/10K tokens, regression tests for forgetting.
- **Deliverables:** memory service prototype, storage adapters, evaluation harness.

## 4. Agent Intelligence & Orchestration (Weeks 4–10)
- **Project Manager agent:**
  - Maintains plan-of-record, milestone burndown, dependency graph.
  - Monitors other agents (Implementer, Reviewer, Researcher) and reassigns tasks.
  - Escalates ambiguities, ensures context hand-offs.
- **Reasoning quality:** develop reasoning prompts, use self-critique + verification loops, integrate test execution feedback.
- **Multi-agent protocol:** standardize message schema, error handling, tool call negotiation, and arbitration.
- **Evaluation:** run task suites (benchmark repos, Terminal Bench, custom Codex tasks) to compare success against Warp/OB1 baselines.
- **Deliverables:** orchestrator service, prompt library, evaluation dashboard.

## 5. Terminal UX & Productivity Features (Weeks 5–14)
- **Command blocks:** rich input/output blocks with metadata (exit code, duration, directory). Support inline AI explanations and follow-up suggestions.
- **Command palette & workflows:** fuzzy finder for commands/snippets, shareable recipes, replay with parameterization.
- **Live assistance:** in-line autocomplete, quick fixes, AI "explain" overlays.
- **Session organization:** tabs/panes, stackable layouts, bookmarking, notebooks, Markdown exports.
- **Performance:** target <16ms render latency, smooth scrolling, partial rerendering.
- **Deliverables:** revamped TUI, interaction design specs, telemetry instrumentation.

## 6. Collaboration & Sharing (Weeks 6–16)
- **Live sessions:** peer viewing/editing, handoff controls, synchronized command history.
- **Cloud workspaces:** optional persistent environments with secrets management, team policies, audit logs.
- **Sharing primitives:** one-click gist export, replayable command transcripts, AI-generated postmortems.
- **Governance:** enterprise controls for access, compliance logging, approvals.
- **Deliverables:** collaboration service, CLI commands (`codex share`, `codex join`), admin console mockups.

## 7. DevEx & Automation Enhancements (Weeks 7–18)
- **Workflow automation:** scheduled runs, CI hooks, integrations with issue trackers and deployment pipelines.
- **Template gallery:** curated best-practice tasks (deploy, scaffold, troubleshoot), import/export via MCP.
- **Scripting API:** expose programmable interface (TypeScript/Rust SDK) for automating Codex sessions.
- **Deliverables:** SDK docs, automation examples, CI integrations.

## 8. Observability, Quality, and Safety (Weeks 3–ongoing)
- **Telemetry:** anonymized metrics for latency, errors, agent outcomes; opt-in analytics respecting privacy.
- **Testing:** expand snapshot/UI tests, fuzz terminal interactions, add regression suites for memory + reasoning.
- **Safety:** reinforce sandboxing, command allow/deny lists, sensitive data redaction in transcripts.
- **Deliverables:** observability stack, QA checklist, red-team reports.

## 9. Rollout & Change Management (Weeks 12–20)
- **Phased release:** alpha (internal), beta (select teams), GA (public). Provide migration guides and feature flags.
- **Documentation:** update docs, tutorials, onboarding flows; publish comparison charts vs Warp/OB1.
- **Feedback loops:** structured bug bash, user council, telemetry-driven iteration.
- **Deliverables:** launch playbook, training materials, success metrics report.

## 10. Risks & Mitigations
- **Scope creep:** enforce backlog prioritization, align with success metrics.
- **Latency regressions:** benchmark frequently, optimize streaming, cache embeddings.
- **Memory cost growth:** tiered storage (hot/warm/cold), pruning policies, user controls.
- **Security concerns:** perform external audits, secrets scanning, incident response runbooks.

## 11. Next Immediate Actions
1. Approve discovery workstream and assign leads for architecture, memory, and agent orchestration.
2. Schedule feature deep-dive workshops with Warp/OB1 users to finalize MVP scope.
3. Kick off memory prototype (vector store + summarization) and orchestrator prompt experiments in a feature branch.
4. Draft engineering RFC outline covering terminal engine redesign.
