# Warp/OB1 Final Project Implementation Plan

This document transforms the roadmap and gap analysis into an actionable final project for delivering Warp/OB1 functional parity in Codex CLI. It sequences the foundational work, enumerates concrete deliverables, and aligns milestones across teams so the programme can ship a cohesive MVP and prepare for GA rollout.

## 1. Objectives & Success Criteria
- **Experience parity**: Provide a terminal+agent experience that matches or exceeds Warp/OB1 on rendering fidelity, command organization, and live assistance.
- **Operational readiness**: Ship with the telemetry, testing, and governance needed for production release in sandboxed and connected environments.
- **Measurable wins**: Hit <16 ms render latency for incremental updates, <2 s agent loop turnaround on common tasks, and >90% task success rate in benchmark suites.

## 2. Scope Overview
The final project bundles together the MVP goals from the roadmap:
1. Structured command transcripts with metadata-rich blocks and inline AI annotations.
2. Enhanced multi-agent reasoning loop overseen by the Project Manager agent.
3. Persistent memory layer spanning short, mid, and long-term context with retrieval.
4. Command palette and workflow launcher covering snippets, exec scripts, and templates.
5. Baseline collaboration primitives (shareable transcripts, session bookmarking) needed for later phases.
6. Observability, QA automation, and safety guardrails to monitor and evolve the experience.

Features explicitly out of scope remain: full real-time collaboration, cloud workspace provisioning, and enterprise audit controls beyond MVP needs.

## 3. Workstreams & Deliverables
### 3.1 Terminal & Transcript (Terminal UX Pod)
- **Block model RFC (P0)**: Data schema, storage, rendering contract, and telemetry hooks.
- **Ratatui prototype (P0)**: Incremental block rendering, metadata badges (exit code, duration, workdir), inline annotation slots.
- **Scrollback persistence (P1)**: Lazy loading for long sessions and export-ready transcript packaging.
- **Performance tooling (P1)**: Benchmarks for render latency, GPU renderer spike report.

### 3.2 Memory & Project Management (Memory Pod)
- **Memory hierarchy design (P0)**: Short vs. mid vs. long-term storage adapters with encryption story.
- **Vector store prototype (P0)**: Summarization pipelines, retrieval evaluation harness.
- **Project Manager API (P1)**: Schema for plan-of-record, tasks, risks, decision log.
- **Retention evaluation (P1)**: Automated regression covering 1K/5K/10K token windows.

### 3.3 Agent Orchestration (Agent Intelligence Pod)
- **Prompt library (P0)**: Personas, negotiation protocol, self-critique loops using command/test feedback.
- **Multi-agent transport (P1)**: Message schema, error handling, integration with MCP tooling.
- **Benchmark suite (P1)**: Terminal Bench, Codex task packs, Warp/OB1 comparisons with dashboards.

### 3.4 Productivity & Automation (Productivity Pod)
- **Command palette spec (P0)**: Keyboard shortcuts, fuzzy search UX, plugin slots.
- **Palette integration (P1)**: Surfacing exec scripts, saved snippets, workflow templates.
- **Workflow launcher (P1)**: Parameterized templates, scheduling hooks for future automation.

### 3.5 Collaboration & Sharing (Collaboration Pod)
- **Share primitives (P1)**: Exportable transcript blocks, public/private share links, basic RBAC stubs.
- **Session organization (P1)**: Tabs/panes roadmap alignment, bookmarking, notebook export design.

### 3.6 Observability & Safety (Platform Pod)
- **Telemetry event spec (P0)**: Latency, agent outcomes, memory hits with opt-in toggles.
- **Snapshot/UI expansion (P1)**: Coverage for block rendering and agent transcripts.
- **Safety review (P1)**: Sandbox assertions, secret redaction, incident response checklist.

## 4. Integrated Timeline (18-Week Programme)
| Phase | Weeks | Focus | Primary Deliverables |
|-------|-------|-------|----------------------|
| Discovery Wrap | 1–2 | Finalize backlog, staffing, and RFC approvals | Block model RFC, memory hierarchy design, palette spec |
| Foundations | 3–6 | Build terminal prototype, memory prototype, prompt library | Ratatui block prototype, vector store prototype, prompt packs |
| Systems Integration | 7–10 | Connect memory ↔ agent ↔ terminal, expand palette | Project Manager API, multi-agent transport, palette integration |
| Experience Polish | 11–14 | UX refinements, performance tuning, share primitives | Scrollback persistence, workflow launcher, share links |
| Hardening & Launch Prep | 15–18 | Testing, telemetry dashboards, rollout assets | Snapshot suite, performance benchmarks, launch playbook |

Dependencies and cross-stream checkpoints occur at the end of each phase with demoable artifacts for leadership review.

## 5. Execution Details
- **Cadence**: Bi-weekly integrated demos; weekly pod standups with Project Manager agent updates captured in decision log.
- **Tooling**: Shared RFC repo, telemetry dashboards, evaluation harness for retention and agent success.
- **Risk Mitigation**:
  - Rendering complexity → maintain feature flag for block view, run A/B with current transcript.
  - Storage costs → tiered retention policies with user controls and pruning heuristics.
  - Agent reliability → fallback to single-agent mode when arbitration fails, log incidents for prompt tuning.
  - Privacy → default local storage, optional encrypted sync with RBAC gating.

## 6. Validation & Rollout
1. **Technical validation**: Automated regression suites (rendering, memory, agent loops) plus manual scenario testing.
2. **Beta cohort**: Invite power users from Warp/OB1 communities, capture telemetry + qualitative feedback.
3. **Documentation**: Update getting started, configuration, and sandbox docs; publish comparison chart vs. Warp/OB1.
4. **Launch**: Phase rollout (internal → beta → GA), publish success metrics report, schedule follow-on work for collaboration/enterprise features.

## 7. Post-Launch Next Steps
- Expand collaboration into real-time co-editing and team spaces.
- Layer enterprise governance (approvals, audit dashboards) based on telemetry learnings.
- Iterate on GPU rendering spike outcomes to determine next-gen terminal engine investment.
- Grow automation templates and SDKs for CI/CD integrations.
